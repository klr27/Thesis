# Creative Computation Capstone Project and Art History Honors Thesis

At SMU I was accepted into the Engaged Learning Program to conduct and Art History Honors Thesis in conjunction with my Creative Computation Capstone Project. I was studying Sol LeWitt's relation to algorithm and searching for any conenctions between him and the early computer artist group, The Algorists. I was also researching what it means to translate Sol LeWitt's instruction drawings in code and how Sol LeWitt might have rewritten his instructions if Processing was his medium.

## The Experiment

I conducted an experiment with the students in the Art and Code I class at SMU in which I gave them various Sol LeWitt instructions and asked them to create the drawings in Processing. The make-up of the class was varied and only a few people knew Sol LeWitt. I gave a brief overview of Sol LeWitt but didn't give too much instruction or information as I wanted genuine results. The code files in this repository are from this experiment.


### Note

I was unable to complete my thesis due to falling ill in a January term class and therefore being forced to drop my double major in art history and my thesis to complete a core requirement as I was a transfer student from Duke and the core requirements were different.
